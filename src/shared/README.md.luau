# Luau showcase repository

Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.2.1.

## Getting Started
This is an open source Luau project that demonstrates my abilities as a programmer to
the the [Quantum Science Structural Team](https://www.roblox.com/groups/2847031/Quantum-Science-Inc#!/about)
for an application.

All files were compiled from a [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) client to a
file structure that Roblox's compiler can understand. This means that the default
Roblox Script Editor was not used and instead Visual Studio Code was used as an
alternative to provide support for GitHub.
I also used [Better Comments](https://github.com/aaron-bond/better-comments)
throughout this project to help visuallize special and/or important parts of the
codebase.
For Luau syntax, linting, type checking, ect. - I use [Roblox LSP](https://github.com/NightrainsRbx/RobloxLsp).
